# [**What is Design Pattern ?**](#what-is-design-pattern)
Software development is an iterative process and there are many problems which developers has to face up to many times. Programmers could come up with an idea for addressing the problem yet it isn't the most effective. Design pattern supplies best optimized "samples" (or maybe "patterns") in getting programming with OOP.

Design patterns are the solution for software problems that we copes fluently.

The outstanding thing of design pattern is reusable.

# [**Why shall we use Design Pattern ?**](#why-shall-we-use-design-pattern)

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.

In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

# [**When shall we take advance of Design Pattern ?**](#when-shall-we-take-advance-of-design-pattern)

If you desires your application more simpler as more as possible. Implementing **Design Pattern** save our time & efforts to figure out solution to problems having correct way to fix.

# [**What you need to prepare before learning Design pattern ?**](#what-you-need-to-prepare-before-learning-design-pattern)

You must understand deeply 4 principles in [**Object-Oriented Programming**](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP)(OOP). They includes: 

1. Inheritance

2. Encapsulation

3. Abstraction

4. Polymorphism

In addition, you have to identify `Interface` & `Abstraction` 

100% thinking by OOP

# [**Types of design pattern**](#types-of-design-pattern)

There are 3 types of design pattern that we usually utilize. They comprise:

- Creational

- Structural

- Behavioural


## [**Creational**](#creational)

***CREATIONAL PATTERN INCLUDES 5 SAMPLES***
</h3>

Creational pattern comprise 5 prototypes: 

1. Factory Method

2. Abstract Method

3. Singleton

4. Builder

5. Prototype


Instead of creating an object with `new` method, creational pattern provides a solution to instantiate an object & hide the logical way to create it. This way makes an application more flexible when it determines which objects will be created depend on what situation happens.

<h3 align="center">

***THERE ARE 7 SAMPLES IN STRUCTURAL PATTERN***
</h3>

When it comes to **structural pattern**, it consists:

1. Adapter

2. Bridge

3. Composite

4. Decorator

5. Facade

6. Flyweight

Structural pattern relates to `class` and `object's components`. It is used to define relationship between 2 or more classes.

***THERE ARE 11 SAMPLES IN BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN***
</h3>

Behavioural pattern consists: 

1. Chain of responsibility

2. Command

3. Iterator

4. Mediator

5. Memento

6. Observer

7. State

8. Strategy

9. Template method

10. Visitor

11. Interpreter

They are used to take actions with objects, communication among objects.
